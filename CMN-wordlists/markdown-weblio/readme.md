These files have been generated through a python script.

These markdown files are generated with weblio links instead of reikoku links. To ensure links containing punctuation work, all links have been url encoded. 

For the wordlists it first searches a core 6k list, then a custom list of words previous not found, finally jmdict. I only want one definition per entry, unfortunatly jmdict can return multiple entries and the first one is sometimes not suitable or obscure. I'm slowly weeding these out. This leads to there being a few words not found. Usually because they are phrases or grammar points, or because the raw list contains brakets or other punctuation. They still have auto generated weblio links to aid in manually editing the file.
