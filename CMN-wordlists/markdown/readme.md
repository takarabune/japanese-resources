These files have been generated through a python script.

For the wordlists it first searches a core 6k list, then a custom list of words previous not found, finally jmdict. 
I only want one definition per entry, unfortunatly jmdict can return multiple entries and the first one is sometimes not suitable or obscure. I'm slowly weeding these out. 
This leads to there being a few words not found. Usually because they phrases or because the raw list contains brakets or other punctuation. They have auto generated weblio links to aid in manually editing the file. 

The reikoku links only work on an iPad with that dictionary installed. 
In the future I may regenerate these files using weblio only for the links.
