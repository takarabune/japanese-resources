### CMN Wordlists

The time needed to manually lookup the English on the wordlists in CNM annoyed me. Here long after I finished a course are those lists with definitions and links to save others the time better spent on more actual learning. 

The raw lists in csv format giving kana, kanji, pagenumber. OCR was used in compiling them. There is a possibility a character or two may have escaped my proofreading. 

Markdown files with links to Monokakido's Reikoku dictionary, and a breakdown of the kanji used in the list. The links will only work if you have the dictionary on an iPad. 

tsv files giving kanji, kana, english suitable for import to a Flashcard app. 

appstore link for Reikoku dictionary (strong recommend) It is a Japanese dictionary for Japanese children, clearer than a mainstream monolingual dictionary as a resource for intermediate learners.
